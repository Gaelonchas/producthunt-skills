## Key Rules for Product Hunt

1. **Never ask for upvotes** - Ask for "support" or "feedback" instead
2. **Launch at 12:01 AM PST** - Maximize your 24-hour window
3. **First 4 hours are critical** - Focus maximum effort here
4. **Respond to every comment** - Engagement boosts algorithm ranking
5. **Stagger outreach** - Don't send all emails at once (looks spammy)
