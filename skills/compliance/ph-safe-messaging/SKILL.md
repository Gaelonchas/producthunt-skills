# Product Hunt Safe Messaging

This skill helps you write messages that effectively rally support while staying within Product Hunt's community guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing launch day emails
- Creating social media posts
- Briefing supporters
- Responding to "how can I help?" questions
- Crafting any public launch messaging

## The Core Principle

**NEVER explicitly ask for upvotes.**

Product Hunt guidelines are clear: asking or incentivizing people to upvote can trigger algorithm penalties or get your product unfeatured.

## Language Conversion Guide

### Forbidden → Allowed

| ❌ Don't Say | ✓ Say Instead |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Please upvote" | "Check it out" |
| "Vote for us" | "We'd love your support" |
| "Upvote if you like it" | "Let us know what you think" |
| "Every vote counts" | "Your feedback means a lot" |
| "Help us reach #1" | "Excited to share this with you" |
| "Click the upvote button" | "Take a look and share your thoughts" |
| "We need your upvotes" | "We need your feedback" |
| "Vote now" | "Check it out now" |

### Incentive Language

| ❌ Don't Say | ✓ Say Instead |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Upvote for 20% off" | "PH community gets 20% off" |
| "Voters get early access" | "Everyone from PH gets early access" |
| "First 100 upvoters win" | "First 100 signups from PH win" |
| "Vote to enter giveaway" | "Visit our PH page to enter giveaway" |

### Supporter Briefing

**What to Tell Supporters:**
```
Hey! Just a quick note on how to support our
Product Hunt launch:

PLEASE DO:
✓ Check out the product page
✓ Leave a genuine comment about your thoughts
✓ Share with anyone who might find it useful
✓ Answer any questions others have

PLEASE DON'T:
✗ Just write "Great product!" (low value)
✗ All comment at the exact same time
✗ Create new accounts just to support
✗ Copy/paste the same comment

The most valuable thing? Authentic engagement.
Tell us what you actually think!

Link: [Link]
```

### Responding to "How Can I Help?"

**When Someone Asks:**

❌ Don't say:
"Please go upvote!"

✓ Do say:
```
Thanks so much for asking!

Here's what would be most helpful:
1. Check out our page: [Link]
2. If you genuinely like it, leave a comment
   with your thoughts
3. Share with anyone you think would find it useful

Your honest feedback is what we're really after.
If you see things we should improve, I want to
hear that too!
```

### Handling Comment Requests

**When Preparing Comment Examples:**

❌ Don't say:
"Please post this exact comment: [script]"

✓ Do say:
```
Some ideas for what to comment about:
• What problem this solves for you
• A feature you find interesting
• A question about how something works
• Honest feedback on what could be better

Make it your own — authentic voices are way
more valuable than scripted comments!
```
