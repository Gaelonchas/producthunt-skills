## Risk Assessment Checklist

### Before Launch

**High Risk (Don't Do):**
- [ ] Are you using any vote service?
- [ ] Are you offering rewards for votes?
- [ ] Are you asking directly for upvotes?
- [ ] Are new accounts being created to vote?

**Medium Risk (Be Careful):**
- [ ] Are you sending mass emails at once?
- [ ] Are all supporters voting same time?
- [ ] Do all comments look similar?
- [ ] Are you messaging PH users directly?

**Low Risk (But Stay Alert):**
- [ ] Is your product clearly explained?
- [ ] Are your claims accurate?
- [ ] Is your offer clearly communicated?

### During Launch

**Watch For:**
- Sudden drops in vote count
- Product disappearing from homepage
- Comments being removed
- Unusual metric patterns

## Safe Practices Guide

### Safe Outreach

**Email Best Practices:**
```
✓ DO: Send to segmented lists in waves
✓ DO: Personalize messages
✓ DO: Ask for "support" or "feedback"
✓ DO: Respect unsubscribes

✗ DON'T: Send to purchased lists
✗ DON'T: Use same message for everyone
✗ DON'T: Ask for "upvotes"
✗ DON'T: Spam non-subscribers
```

**Social Media Best Practices:**
```
✓ DO: Share authentically
✓ DO: Spread posts throughout day
✓ DO: Engage with responses
✓ DO: Thank supporters

✗ DON'T: Post same link repeatedly
✗ DON'T: Use engagement pods
✗ DON'T: Ask for votes publicly
✗ DON'T: Spam hashtags
```

### Safe Supporter Activation

**Do:**
- Activate in waves (not all at once)
- Use different time zones
- Encourage genuine comments
- Let people vote if they want

**Don't:**
- Coordinate exact voting times
- Script identical comments
- Pressure reluctant people
- Force anyone to participate

### Safe Messaging Templates

**Instead of:** "Please upvote our product!"
**Say:** "We just launched — would love your feedback!"

**Instead of:** "Every vote counts!"
**Say:** "Your support means a lot to us."

**Instead of:** "Help us reach #1!"
**Say:** "Check it out and let us know what you think."

**Instead of:** "Vote to win a prize"
**Say:** "PH community gets 20% off (no vote required)"
