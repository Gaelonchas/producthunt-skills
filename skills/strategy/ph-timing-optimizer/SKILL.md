# Product Hunt Timing Optimizer

This skill helps you choose the optimal launch timing based on your goals, available resources, and competitive landscape.

## When to Use This Skill

- Deciding which day of the week to launch
- Understanding timezone implications
- Planning for specific audience targeting
- Balancing competition vs. traffic trade-offs
- Coordinating global team availability

## The Golden Rule

**Launch at 12:01 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST)**

Product Hunt's daily cycle resets at midnight PST. Launching at 12:01 AM gives you the full 24 hours of visibility.
