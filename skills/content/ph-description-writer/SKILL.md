## Copywriting Formulas

### Formula 1: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Structure:**
1. **Attention:** Hook with a bold statement or question
2. **Interest:** Expand on the problem or opportunity
3. **Desire:** Show how your product delivers results
4. **Action:** Clear CTA

**Example:**
```
Tired of losing hours to scattered notes? (A)

Your ideas deserve a home where they connect and grow. (I)

[Product] links your notes automatically, surfacing insights
you'd never find manually. 10,000+ users rediscovered their
own brilliance. (D)

Start free today → (A)
```

### Formula 2: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** State the pain point clearly
2. **Agitate:** Make the pain feel urgent
3. **Solution:** Present your product as the answer

**Example:**
```
Building APIs takes weeks of boilerplate. (P)

Meanwhile, your competitors ship faster, iterate quicker,
and steal your market while you're still writing CRUD
endpoints. (A)

[Product] generates production-ready APIs from your database
in 60 seconds. What took weeks now takes a coffee break. (S)
```

---

### Formula 3: FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)

**Structure:**
1. **Features:** What your product has
2. **Advantages:** Why that's better than alternatives
3. **Benefits:** What the user gains

**Example:**
```
AI-powered code review (F)

Catches bugs 10x faster than manual review, learns your
codebase patterns (A)

Ship with confidence, never deploy broken code again,
sleep better at night (B)
```

---

### Formula 4: BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

**Structure:**
1. **Before:** Current painful state
2. **After:** Desired future state
3. **Bridge:** How your product gets them there

**Example:**
```
BEFORE: Spending 5+ hours weekly on manual reporting,
copy-pasting between tools, dreading Monday status
meetings.

AFTER: Automated dashboards update in real-time,
stakeholders self-serve, you focus on actual work.

THE BRIDGE: [Product] connects your tools and generates
reports automatically. Set up in 10 minutes, save 5
hours weekly.
```

### Formula 5: 4 Ps (Promise-Picture-Proof-Push)

**Structure:**
1. **Promise:** What they'll achieve
2. **Picture:** Help them visualize success
3. **Proof:** Evidence it works
4. **Push:** Urgent CTA

**Example:**
```
Double your email reply rates. (Promise)

Imagine opening your inbox to engaged prospects ready to
talk, instead of cricket sounds. (Picture)

12,000 sales reps average 47% reply rates with [Product],
vs 8% industry average. (Proof)
