## Tagline Testing Checklist

### Clarity Test
- [ ] Can someone outside your industry understand it?
- [ ] Does it pass the "explain to mom" test?
- [ ] Would a 10-year-old get the gist?

### Specificity Test
- [ ] Could this tagline only describe YOUR product?
- [ ] Is it different from competitors' messaging?
- [ ] Does it avoid generic terms?

### Value Test
- [ ] Is the benefit immediately clear?
- [ ] Does it answer "What's in it for me?"
- [ ] Would you click based on this tagline alone?

### Character Count Test
- [ ] Under 60 characters? (Required)
- [ ] Under 50 characters? (Better)
- [ ] Every word necessary? (Best)

## What to AVOID

### Red Flags
- ❌ "World's first..." (Unprovable, distracting)
- ❌ "Revolutionary..." (Empty buzzword)
- ❌ "AI-powered..." (Overused, meaningless alone)
- ❌ "All-in-one..." (Vague, unfocused)
- ❌ "Best..." (Subjective, unbelievable)
- ❌ "Next-gen..." (Meaningless)

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Being clever over being clear
- ❌ Using internal jargon
- ❌ Focusing on features over benefits
- ❌ Trying to say too much
- ❌ Being vague to sound inclusive
