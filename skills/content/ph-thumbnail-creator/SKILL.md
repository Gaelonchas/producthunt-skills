## Thumbnail Strategy

### The 3-Second Rule
Users spend ~3 seconds scanning the homepage. Your thumbnail must:
1. **Stop the scroll** (visual differentiation)
2. **Communicate category** (what type of product)
3. **Spark curiosity** (reason to click)

### Thumbnail Types

#### Type 1: Logo Only
**Best for:** Well-known brands, simple products
```
┌─────────────┐
│             │
│    LOGO     │
│             │
└─────────────┘
```
**Pros:** Clean, professional, brandable
**Cons:** Doesn't show product, less engaging

---

#### Type 2: Product Screenshot
**Best for:** Apps with distinctive UI
```
┌─────────────┐
│  ┌───────┐  │
│  │ App   │  │
│  │ UI    │  │
│  └───────┘  │
└─────────────┘
```
**Pros:** Shows actual product, sets expectations
**Cons:** Small space, may look cluttered

---

#### Type 3: Mascot/Character
**Best for:** Playful brands, consumer apps
```
┌─────────────┐
│             │
│   (◕‿◕)    │
│             │
└─────────────┘
```
**Pros:** Memorable, personality-driven
**Cons:** Doesn't explain product

---

#### Type 4: Animated GIF
**Best for:** Products with visual actions
```
┌─────────────┐
│  Before →   │
│             │
│  → After    │
└─────────────┘
```
**Pros:** Shows product in action, eye-catching
**Cons:** More work, technical constraints

---

#### Type 5: Icon + Text
**Best for:** Abstract products, tools
```
┌─────────────┐
│     📊      │
│             │
│  PRODUCT   │
│   NAME     │
└─────────────┘
```
**Pros:** Explains function, clean
**Cons:** May look generic

## GIF Animation Ideas

### For Different Product Types

## Design Best Practices

### Do:
- ✓ Use high contrast colors
- ✓ Keep it simple (one focal point)
- ✓ Ensure readability at 240px
- ✓ Test on dark/light backgrounds
- ✓ Make first GIF frame strongest
- ✓ Use brand colors if recognizable

### Don't:
- ✗ Include small text (unreadable)
- ✗ Use too many elements
- ✗ Create strobing/flashing effects
- ✗ Make GIF too long (2-3 sec loops ideal)
- ✗ Rely on animation alone (first frame matters)
- ✗ Use generic stock imagery

## Color Psychology

| Color | Association | Best For |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Blue | Trust, Tech | B2B, SaaS |
| Green | Growth, Money | Finance, Health |
| Purple | Premium, Creative | Design, AI |
| Orange | Energy, Action | Productivity |
| Red | Urgency, Bold | Limited offers |
| Yellow | Optimism, Attention | Consumer apps |
| Black | Premium, Elegant | Luxury, Tools |

## Competitive Differentiation

### Study Your Launch Day
- What colors dominate other thumbnails?
- Are most static or animated?
- How can you visually stand out?

### Stand Out Strategies
1. **Color contrast** - If feed is blue, go orange
2. **Animation** - If others static, use GIF
3. **Simplicity** - If others busy, go minimal
4. **Bold style** - If others subtle, go bright

## Tool Recommendations

### For Static Thumbnails
- **Figma** - Free, powerful, collaborative
- **Canva** - Easy templates
- **Photoshop** - Full control

### For Animated GIFs
- **Lottie/LottieFiles** - Smooth animations
- **Figma + plugins** - Animate layers
- **After Effects** - Professional quality
- **ScreenToGif** - Capture product in action
- **Giphy** - Simple GIF creation

### For Product Demos as GIFs
- **Arcade** - Interactive demos
- **ScreenStory** - Polished screen recordings
- **CleanShot X** - Mac screen capture
