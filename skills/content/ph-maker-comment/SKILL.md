## Complete Maker Comment Examples

### Example 1: Solo Maker (Authentic/Personal)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Sarah, and I built [Product] over the past 6 months while
working nights and weekends.

The story: Last year, I lost a $50k client because I missed
their email buried in my inbox. That hurt. I tried every email
tool out there, but nothing actually solved MY problem —
knowing which emails would cost me money if ignored.

So I built [Product]. It's an AI that learns your business
relationships and surfaces emails that matter most. Not based
on keywords — based on actual relationship and deal context.

What makes it different: We don't organize your inbox. We
just show you the 5-10 emails per day that actually need your
attention. Everything else can wait.

For the PH community: Free forever for up to 2 email accounts.
No credit card, no catch.

I'd genuinely love your feedback — what email problems am I
missing? And what would make this more useful for your workflow?

Thanks for being here! I'll be responding to every single
comment today. 🙏

— Sarah

### Example 2: Team Launch (Professional/Credible)

```
Hi Product Hunt!

I'm Mike, co-founder of [Product] along with my partners
[Name] (ex-Stripe) and [Name] (ex-Google).

We spent 2 years building the developer tool we wished
existed. Here's why:

THE PROBLEM: Deploying microservices still sucks. Every
team reinvents the same infrastructure. The average startup
spends 30% of engineering time on DevOps instead of product.

OUR SOLUTION: [Product] gives you production-ready infrastructure
with one command. Kubernetes, monitoring, CI/CD, secrets
management — all configured and connected.

THE DIFFERENCE: We're not another "Heroku for X". We give you
real infrastructure you control, with the simplicity of a
PaaS. No lock-in, full visibility.

🎁 PH EXCLUSIVE: 3 months free on our Pro plan (normally $299/mo).
Code: HUNT2024

We've been heads-down building, so we're genuinely excited
to hear what you think. What would make this more valuable
for your team?

All three of us will be here answering questions!

Best,
Mike, [Name] & [Name]
```
