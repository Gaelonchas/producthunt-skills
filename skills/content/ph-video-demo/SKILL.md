## Demo Section Best Practices

### Show, Don't Tell
- ✓ Cursor movements with purpose
- ✓ Highlight clicks with zoom/callouts
- ✓ Real data (or realistic fake data)
- ✓ Smooth, practiced actions

### Pacing
- ✓ Fast enough to maintain interest
- ✓ Slow enough to follow
- ✓ Pause on key moments
- ✓ No dead time

### What to Demonstrate
1. **Simplest path to value** (Getting started)
2. **Most impressive feature** (The wow)
3. **Unique differentiator** (Why you, not them)

## Voice & Narration

### Option 1: Founder Voiceover
**Pros:** Authentic, personal, builds connection
**Cons:** May not be professional quality

**Tips:**
- Use external microphone
- Record in quiet space
- Speak naturally, not scripted
- Energy matters!

### Option 2: Professional VO
**Pros:** Polished, clear
**Cons:** Less personal, costs money

### Option 3: No Voice (Music + Text)
**Pros:** Universal (no language barrier)
**Cons:** Less engaging, harder to follow

**If using text overlays:**
- Large, readable font
- High contrast
- Short phrases
- Synced with actions

### Option 4: AI Voiceover
**Tools:** ElevenLabs, Murf, Play.ht
**Pros:** Quick, consistent, multiple takes
**Cons:** Can sound robotic

## Visual Production
