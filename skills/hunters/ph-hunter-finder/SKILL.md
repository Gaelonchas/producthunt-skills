Hi [Hunter Name],

I've been following your hunts on Product Hunt,
especially [specific product they hunted] which
caught my eye because [reason].

I'm building [Product] — [one-line description].

I think it might interest you because:

[Brief traction if any: users, notable feedback, etc.]

Would you be open to taking a look? I'd value your
feedback even if hunting isn't the right fit.

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]

### What Hunters Look For
- Product quality and readiness
- Clear value proposition
- Professional presentation
- Genuine maker passion
- Realistic expectations
- Respectful approach

### What Turns Hunters Off
- Incomplete products
- Unclear what it does
- Entitlement attitude
- Asking without research
- Pressure tactics
- Payment offers (against guidelines)

## Working With a Hunter

### If They Agree

**Discuss:**
- Launch date preference
- Asset requirements
- Review of listing
- Launch day coordination
- Communication during launch

**Provide:**
- All necessary assets
- Product access
- Key talking points
- Quick response availability

**Maintain:**
- Professional communication
- Timely responses
- Openness to feedback
- Gratitude

### Hunter's Role

**They Will:**
- Post your product
- Their followers get notified
- May provide feedback on assets
- Amplify through their network

**They Won't:**

## Alternative: Hunter as Advisor

Even without officially hunting, valuable hunters can:
- Review your listing
- Provide strategic feedback
- Share from their account
- Connect you with others

This mentorship can be more valuable than just the hunt.

## The Paid Hunter Question

### Official Stance
Product Hunt guidelines discourage paying for hunts.

### Reality
Some hunters charge, but consider:
- Best hunters hunt for free (they're selective)
- Paying doesn't guarantee results
- Could violate community trust
- Better to invest in product quality

### Recommendation
Focus on making your product so good that hunters want to hunt it for free.
