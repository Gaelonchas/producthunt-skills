# Product Hunt Relaunch Strategy

This skill helps you plan and execute successful relaunches on Product Hunt, building on your previous launch experience.

## When to Use This Skill

- Evaluating if you should relaunch
- Understanding relaunch rules
- Preparing for a version 2.0 launch
- Maximizing relaunch impact
- Timing your next launch

## Relaunch Rules

### Official Guidelines

**Standard Rule:**
- Can relaunch after 6 months
- Must have significant updates

**Exceptions:**
- Major product pivot (can be sooner)
- New product with different name/URL (anytime)
- V2 with substantial changes (request approval)

### What Counts as "Significant"

**Qualifies for Relaunch:**
- Major version release (v2.0)
- Complete redesign
- New core features
- Platform expansion
- Pivot/rebrand

**Does NOT Qualify:**
- Minor bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- UI tweaks
- Pricing changes
- New integrations alone

## Should You Relaunch?

### Relaunch Decision Matrix

| Question | Yes = Relaunch | No = Wait |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 6+ months since last launch? | ✓ | Need approval |
| Major new features/version? | ✓ | Need more changes |
| Compelling new story to tell? | ✓ | Need better angle |
| Bigger audience now? | ✓ | Build audience first |
| First launch was learning? | ✓ | Optimize first |

### When to Relaunch

**Good Reasons:**
- V2 with major improvements
- Expansion to new platform
- Major feature launch
- Significant pivot
- Acquired large user base

**Bad Reasons:**
- First launch underperformed
- Want more upvotes
- Nothing new, just want attention
- Gaming the system

## Relaunch Strategy

### Timing Your Relaunch

**Wait Until You Have:**
- 2-3 major new features minimum
- Clear differentiation from v1
- Compelling new story
- Larger support network than before
- Lessons applied from first launch

**Bundle Updates:**
Instead of launching each feature separately, combine:
- Feature A + Feature B + Feature C = "Major Update Launch"

### Positioning the Relaunch

**Approach 1: "Version 2.0"**
```
[Product] 2.0: Now with [major improvement]

We listened to your feedback. Here's everything new:
• [Feature 1]
• [Feature 2]
• [Feature 3]
```

**Approach 2: "Complete Redesign"**
```
[Product] — Completely Rebuilt

Same mission, totally new experience:
• [Improvement 1]
• [Improvement 2]
• [Improvement 3]
```

**Approach 3: "Platform Expansion"**
```
[Product] for [New Platform]

By popular demand: [Product] is now on [Platform]
• [Platform-specific feature]
• [Platform-specific feature]
```

### What's Different This Time

**Learn from First Launch:**

| First Launch Issue | Second Launch Fix |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Weak tagline | Test tagline beforehand |
| Low engagement | Build bigger supporter network |
| Poor timing | Choose optimal day |
| Rushed assets | Professional design |
| No video | Compelling demo video |

## Preparing for Relaunch
