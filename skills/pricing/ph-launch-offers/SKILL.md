# Product Hunt Launch Offers

This skill helps you create compelling promotional offers for your Product Hunt launch that drive conversions while staying within community guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing your launch promotion
- Deciding between discount types
- Creating urgency and exclusivity
- Structuring lifetime deals
- Maximizing launch conversions

## The Golden Rule

**Offers must NOT be tied to voting.**

✓ Allowed: "Product Hunt community gets 20% off"
✗ Forbidden: "Upvote to get 20% off"

## Types of Launch Offers

### Type 1: Percentage Discount

**Format:** X% off for Y period

**Common Structures:**
- 20% off first year
- 30% off first 3 months

```

**Best For:**
- SaaS products
- Subscription services
- Recurring revenue models

### Type 2: Lifetime Deal (LTD)

**Format:** One-time payment for lifetime access

**Common Structures:**
- $99 lifetime (vs $29/month)
- $199 lifetime (vs $49/month)
- Tiered: $49 / $99 / $199

**Example:**
```

$99 one-time (normally $29/month)

**Considerations:**
- Attracts deal hunters (may not be long-term users)

---

### Type 3: Extended Trial

**Format:** Longer free trial than normal

**Common Structures:**
- 60 days free (vs 14 days)
- 3 months free trial
- "Forever free" during beta

---

### Type 4: Feature Unlock

**Format:** Access to premium features for free

- Pro features free for 6 months
- Premium tier at free tier price

**Example:**
```
🔓 Unlock Pro Features
Product Hunt users get Pro features
at the Free tier price — forever
```

---

### Type 5: Bundle/Bonus

---

### Type 6: Early Adopter Pricing

**Format:** Locked-in lower price forever

**Common Structures:**
- Current price locked forever
- Grandfather early users
- Beta pricing permanently

**Example:**
```
Early Adopter Pricing
Lock in $19/month forever
(Price increases to $39/month soon)
```

**Best For:**
- Products planning to raise prices
- Building loyal early base
- Creating urgency

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
Show the "real" price to make the deal feel valuable.

```
$99/year (normally $199) — 50% off!
```

### Scarcity
Limit availability to create urgency.

```
Limited to first 100 users from Product Hunt
Only 23 spots remaining
```

### Urgency
Time-limit the offer.

```
Expires in 48 hours
Launch week only
Valid through Sunday
```

### Exclusivity
Make PH community feel special.

```
Exclusive for Product Hunt
Not available anywhere else
PH community only
```
