# Product Hunt Supporter Network

This skill helps you build, organize, and activate a network of supporters who will genuinely engage with your Product Hunt launch.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building your pre-launch supporter list
- Categorizing supporters by relationship strength
- Creating outreach templates for different groups
- Coordinating launch day support
- Maximizing authentic engagement

## Why Supporter Networks Matter

### The Reality
- Top launches have 50-200+ active supporters
- Algorithm weighs account quality heavily
- Genuine engagement > raw numbers
- Comments matter as much as upvotes

### What Makes Good Support
- ✓ Actual Product Hunt users (not new accounts)
- ✓ Thoughtful comments (not just "Great!")
- ✓ Authentic interest in your product
- ✓ Staggered engagement (not all at once)

## Building Your Supporter List

### Categories of Supporters

#### Tier 1: Inner Circle (Target: 20-50)
**Who:**
- Co-founders, team members
- Close friends and family (who use PH)
- Early beta users
- Advisors and investors

**Characteristics:**
- Will definitely support
- High engagement quality
- Personal relationship

---

#### Tier 2: Warm Network (Target: 50-100)
**Who:**
- Professional connections
- Industry peers
- Past colleagues
- Active community members

**Characteristics:**
- Likely to support if asked
- Understand your product
- Have PH accounts

---

#### Tier 3: Extended Network (Target: 100-300)
**Who:**
- Newsletter subscribers
- Social media followers
- Past customers
- One-time interactions

**Characteristics:**
- May support if convenient
- Less personal connection
- Varying PH activity levels

---

#### Tier 4: Reciprocal (Target: 20-50)
**Who:**
- Other makers you've supported
- Launch swap partners
- Community reciprocity

**Characteristics:**
- Mutual benefit relationship
- Understand launch dynamics
- Active PH users

## Supporter Qualification

### Ideal Supporter Profile
- ✓ Has Product Hunt account
- ✓ Account is 30+ days old
- ✓ Has some activity history
- ✓ Genuinely interested in your product category
- ✓ Can write thoughtful comment

### Red Flags (Don't Pursue)
- ❌ No PH account and unwilling to create
- ❌ Would create account just for your launch
- ❌ No genuine interest in your product
- ❌ Only offering transactional exchange
- ❌ History of spam behavior

## Pre-Launch Relationship Building

### Timeline

- Start mapping your network
- Identify potential supporters
- Begin meaningful interactions

**4-6 Weeks Before:**
- Reach out to key supporters
- Share early access/previews
- Get feedback and buy-in

**2-3 Weeks Before:**
- Confirm supporter availability
- Share launch details
- Provide any needed resources

**1 Week Before:**
- Final confirmation
- Send calendar invites
- Share exact timing

**1 Day Before:**
- Last reminder
- Share comment ideas
- Express gratitude
