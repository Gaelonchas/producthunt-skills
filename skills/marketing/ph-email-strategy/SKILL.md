# Product Hunt Email Strategy

This skill helps you plan and execute email campaigns that drive engagement for your Product Hunt launch while staying compliant with community guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning pre-launch email sequence
- Writing launch day email campaigns
- Timing email waves across timezones
- Crafting compliant outreach messages
- Creating follow-up email sequences

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Never Ask for Upvotes
- ❌ "Please upvote our product"
- ❌ "Every vote counts"
- ❌ "Help us reach #1"
- ✓ "Check it out and share your feedback"
- ✓ "We'd love your support"
- ✓ "Let us know what you think"

### Rule 2: Stagger Your Sends
- Don't send to everyone at once
- Algorithm flags sudden traffic spikes
- Spread across 5-6 waves over 24 hours

### Rule 3: Segment Your Audience
- Different messages for different groups
- Personal > mass email
- Quality engagement > quantity
